    <h1>My treehouse journey to become a python developer and data analyst</h1>

    <!-- *************** Data Analysis ***************** -->
    <hr>
    <h2>DATA ANALYST</h2>

    <p>Data analysis is the process we use to examine information and make better decisions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Natural process when buying something</li>
        <li>Beautiful charts and graphs</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our brains can only process a limited amount of input, we take shortcuts to determine what's important, and
        sometimes we make mistakes. These kinds of errors in perception are called cognitive biases. One of these that
        affects our ability to analyze data is that humans tend to find patterns in completely random data. These can
        cause us to identify trends which are really just random variations overtime. Other cognitive biases lead us to
        put more weight on some observations than others. If we already have an idea of what the data will say, then
        we'll tend to notice examples that confirm our theory. We'll also give more weight to more recent data than we
        give to older data. Data analysis gives us methods to see beyond our biases, to get at the truth of what the
        data shows.</p>
    <p>Data analysis reduces complex sets of information into insights that are easy to understand. And these insights
        can help us make difficult decisions much simpler.</p>

    <h3>First we need to find some data...</h3>
    <p>Data is a record of an event, or an attribute of something.</p>
    <p>A collection of data is usually called a dataset. Generally, this means that all the data in the set is related
        in some way. It may come from a common source, or relate to one specific topic.</p>

    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a>
    <a href="https://data.gov/">US Government's open data </a>
    <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/">UCI Rrepository</a>

    <p>In the workplace, data analysis is a growing field. More and more companies are creating data teams to help them
        make decisions. People in many different positions work with data. In job titles the word analyst often
        indicates that the position involves data analysis. However, other titles are possible.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For example, data scientists combine data analysis with programming and machine learning.</li>
        <li>Different analysts might work with different types of data within a company.</li>
        <li>A web analyst might make recommendations for a company's website based on which pages are visited most, and
            which links are clicked most often.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, a financial analyst would look at revenue and expenses to forecast a company's financial
            performance.</li>
        <li>And a pricing analyst might use purchasing data to determine the optimal prices for products.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Since data is an emerging field, the same title in different companies may mean different things.

    <!-- ************* CODING PRINCIPLES ************ -->
    <hr>
    <h2>CODING PRINCIPLES</h2>
    <p>When it comes to writing code, there are a lot of pitfalls that a developer can run into. This is especially true
        when you are early on in your coding journey. Repetitive, disorganized, or difficult to follow code are some
        examples of these pitfalls, which can lead to errors and make your code more difficult for other developers to
        read. We will discuss several strategies that will make your code more streamlined, more readable, and easier to
        maintain.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Narrative Flow </strong>: involves structuring your code as if it were a story that someone could
            read to understand how your program works. Narrative flow refers to how a story moves. When you structure
            your code like a story, it makes reading and understanding it much easier for yourself and others. This is
            the whole idea behind narrative flow: organize your code in a way that whoever reads it can easily follow
            along with the flow of the story.</li>

        <li><strong>Iterative Coding </strong>: is the process of writing your code in small chunks, which you then
            test, before repeating the process with the next small chunk of code. Iterative coding can be compared to
            the carpentry mantra, "measure twice, cut once".<br>Imagine you were to build a chair without measuring the
            wood. The chair probably wouldn't turn out the way
            you wanted and it might be hard to figure out where the problem is. Is the right leg too long or is the left
            leg too short? Wait, why are there five legs? You might be able to fix it, but it will probably cost you
            extra time and materials to make it right.<br>The same logic applies to building an application without
            testing your code as you go. You are likely to end
            up with some bugs in your code and trying to identify and fix them will probably cost you extra
            time.<br>When writing code, it is important to stop every so often to test your code to make sure everything
            is
            working the way you expect. One common way to do this is with console.log statements.<br>Testing your code
            regularly will allow you to identify and fix bugs sooner, saving you a lot of time and
            frustration.</li>

        <li><strong>KISS (Keep It Simple Silly)</strong> : it reflects the idea that the best option is often the
            simplest option. KISS doesn't necessarily mean less code. It just means focusing on simplicity. While the
            goal is to avoid complexity, there may be times where you can't simplify a complicated piece of
            code. That’s okay. Just be sure to use code comments in those situations to explain the code.
            <ul>
                <li>Remove Unnecessary Code comments</li>
                <li>Give functions and variables descriptive names. If a function returns a boolean, it is a common
                    convention to begin the function name with "is". Ex: function isGreaterThanTen(){}.</li>
                <li>Simplify the Code : simplify conditions, create variables only of needed.</li>
                <li>It is a good practice to try to set up your functions to do one specific task. That isn't always
                    possible but it is a good thing to strive for. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            <strong>DRY </strong>: Don't Repeat Yourself, which is
            something you want to strive for in your code. <br>As programmers, we are often so focused on writing code
            that works that we overlook situations where our code is repetitive.<br>The concept of keeping your code DRY
            is important to keep in mind both when writing and refactoring your code.<br>Create functions, use loops.<a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">Dry principle</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to remember that you should strive to implement these ideas when you are first writing your code
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">Refactoring </a>
        You can also apply these strategies to
        existing code by doing what is called refactoring, which is the process of looking for ways to improve existing
        code.

    <h3>5 - Why you need BEM ?</h3>
    <p>Importance of maintaining code consistency and clarity through proper naming conventions using the BEM (Block
        Element Modifier) methodology. BEM aims to make CSS more modular, portable, and understandable by designers and
        developers. The methodology consists of three types of classes: Block classes (defining the root component),
        Element classes (for child elements), and Modifier classes (for variations or modifications). These classes are
        structured using double underscores and hyphens to clearly separate different parts of the selector. BEM
        principles can be applied to create well-structured and communicative CSS code. BEM improves code organization
        and enhances understanding by indicating the purpose and context of each component and its elements.</p>

    <hr>
    <h2>BUILD A LEARNING MINDSET</h2>
    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>No one's born "smart" or "stupid." Intelligence is something we can always increase by working our brains like
        muscles to grow neurons, and develop deeper and stronger neural connections. In this video learn how a "Growth
        Mindset" can literally help you learn better, while a "Fixed Mindset" can keep you from pushing yourself to
        learn and grow.</p>
    <p>"that looks like it took you a lot of effort to solve this !"</p>
    <p>Growth mindset sees effort as the key to success. A growth mindset likes challenges and accepts failures as just
        one step along the learning path. People must be praised for their efforts so that they pushed themselves to try
        the most challenging task. We can always grow our intelligence and learn new skills. </p>
    <p>"You must be really smart to solve this"</p>
    <p>Fixed mindset. Those that were labelled smart played it safe and tried the simplest. A fixed mindset puts a label
        and a boundary on someone's ability. You are smart... suggest that you've got a fixed amount of intelligence
        that never changes.If you feel like your intelligent can't change, then that's a failure.</p>

    <!-- IMPOSTER SYNDROME -->

    <h3>How to battle imposter syndrome ?</h3>
    <p>Imposter Syndrome, a term used to describe strong and pervasive feelings of self doubt, is a common occurrence in
        just about every field and career. Software developers might experience it more frequently due to the constant
        and rapid changes in technology we are faced with. But we are not alone! Doctors, professors, attorneys, actors,
        authors, and many, many more experience Impostor Syndrome at one time or another.</p>
    <p>The key to handling these feelings of self doubt is to recognize that everyone has doubts about their abilities,
        and that this common feeling can be overcome by understanding that you'll never know everything there is to know
        about any subject. Studying, practicing, and building cool technology will help you become a better, more
        confident developer.</p>

    <p>Here are some resources to learn more about Imposter Syndrome and how to combat these feelings of self-doubt.</p>
    <h4>Tips and tools</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Talk about it!</li>
        <li>Write down wins and victories. Keep track of that in a smile file on your computer.</li>
        <li>When someone gives you reinforcing feedback, take it! Accept compliments, without saying that that was not a
            big deal ! Instead answer, thanks, I enjoyed working on it. I appreciate you saying that I worked hard to
            accomplish this.</li>
        <li>When someone gives you redirecting feed back : take that too! This person believes in your ability to grow.
        </li>
        <li>We are lifelong learners! Every situation make you learn something !</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Overcome it!</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://impostorsyndrome.com/articles/10-steps-overcome-impostor/">Overcome imposter syndrome</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7v-GG3SEWQ">TED by Valerie Young</a></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Break the silence.</strong> Shame keeps a lot of people from “fessing up” about their fraudulent
            feelings. Knowing
            there’s a name for these feelings and that you are not alone can be tremendously freeing. </li>
        <li><strong>Separate feelings from fact.</strong> There are times you’ll feel stupid. It happens to everyone
            from time to time.
            Realize that just because you may feel stupid, doesn’t mean you are.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognize when you should feel fraudulent.</strong> A sense of belonging fosters confidence. If
            you’re the only or
            one of a few people in a meeting, classroom, field, or workplace who look or sound like you or are much
            older or younger, then it’s only natural you’d sometimes feel like you don’t totally fit in. Plus if you’re
            the first woman, people of color, or person with a disability to achieve something in your world, e.g. first
            VP, astronaut, judge, supervisor, firefighter, honoree, etc. there’s that added pressure to represent your
            entire group. Instead of taking your self-doubt as a sign of your ineptness, recognize that it might be a
            normal response to being on the receiving end of social stereotypes about competence and intelligence. </li>
        <li><strong>Accentuate the positive.</strong> The good news is being a perfectionist means you care deeply about
            the quality of
            your work. The key is to continue to strive for excellence when it matters most, but don’t persevere over
            routine tasks and forgive yourself when the inevitable mistake happens. </li>
        <li><strong>Develop a healthy response to failure and mistake making.</strong> Henry Ford once said, “Failure is
            only the
            opportunity to begin again more intelligently.” Instead of beating yourself up for falling short, do what
            players on the losing sports team do and glean the learning value from the loss and move on reminding
            yourself, “I’ll get ’em next time.”</li>
        <li><strong>Right the rules.</strong> If you’ve been operating under misguided rules like, “I should always know
            the
            answer,” or
            “Never ask for help” start asserting your rights. Recognize that you have just as much right as the next
            person to be wrong, have an off-day, or ask for assistance. </li>
        <li><strong>Develop a new script.</strong> Become consciously aware of the conversation going on in your head
            when you’re in a
            situation that triggers your Impostor feelings. This is your internal script. Then instead of thinking,
            “Wait till they find out I have no idea what I’m doing,” tell yourself “Everyone who starts something new
            feels off-base in the beginning. I may not know all the answers but I’m smart enough to find them out.”
            Instead of looking around the room and thinking, “Oh my God everyone here is brilliant…. and I’m not” go
            with “Wow, everyone here is brilliant – I’m really going to learn a lot!”</li>
        <li><strong>Visualize success.</strong> Do what professional athletes do. Spend time beforehand picturing
            yourself making a
            successful presentation or calmly posing your question in class. It sure beats picturing impending disaster
            and will help with performance-related stress. </li>
        <li><strong>Reward yourself.</strong> Break the cycle of continually seeking — and then dismissing — validation
            outside of
            yourself by learning to pat yourself on the back.</li>
        <li><strong>Fake it ‘til you make it.</strong> Now and then we all have to fly by the seat of our pants. Instead
            of considering
            “winging it” as proof of your ineptness, learn to do what many high achievers do and view it as a skill. The
            point of the worn-out phrase, fake it til you make it, still stands: Don’t wait until you feel confident to
            start putting yourself out there. Courage comes from taking risks. Change your behavior first and allow your
            confidence to build.</li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>
    <p>I first saw this acronym in a tweet and it’s presented as a checklist for when you’re feeling emotional. But,
        honestly, don’t you feel pretty emotional when you just can’t get past that one problem? I know I do. So, before
        you start telling yourself that you’re stupid, check these six conditions to make sure you’re in a good
        problem-solving mindset.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cold – It’s hard to think when you’re physically uncomfortable. If you’re cold, put on a sweater or socks.
            If you’re hot, get a fan or go somewhere cooler. I’d say this applies to where you’re working and how you’re
            sitting or standing, too. Make sure you’re stressing yourself with pain or discomfort as little as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Hungry – Your brain needs calories to work. Get something to eat or drink, even something small, to give
            yourself a little boost of energy. I know I’ve had so many problems that I just couldn’t solve until I had a
            few nuts or some gummy bears (a guilty pleasure), and then the pieces slid together so much easier. Along
            with this, drink some water. Keeping yourself hydrated will help with reducing physical discomfort and help
            you keep your mind on the task at hand.</li>
        <li>Angry – Repeatedly running into brick walls will make even the most peaceful of us start to see red
            eventually. I know, personally, I start to see a problem I can’t solve as an enemy. I get, literally, mad at
            the function that won’t return the correct output or the sentence that I just can’t seem to get right. If
            your emotions have started to run away with you, you won’t be able to think your problem through. Take a
            break, do something fun, and get yourself centered.</li>
        <li>Lonely – This one might be a bit of stretch if you’re not wanting to ask questions of your coworkers and
            friends, but a bit of camaraderie goes a long way in getting our minds into a better state. I enjoy playing
            board games and I’ve found that, with a problem I can’t quite get through, that a half hour of Hanabi or
            Codenames helps to get me back to a place where I feel confident in myself again. Snuggles from pets,
            children, loved ones, or even stuffed animals can really help, too.</li>
        <li>Tired – Sometimes we’re just too tired to work our way through a problem right now. That’s fine! We’re all
            human, after all! Take a break, take a nap, or even go to bed for the night. You might even find that your
            brain worked out a new solution to the problem for you while you dozed or marathoned a Netflix show. With
            the proper rest, many big problems become minor annoyances.</li>
        <li>Substances – And, sometimes, you’re just not in the right mindset to solve problems. There’s a common saying
            from the writing world: “Write drunk, edit sober”. Programmers have created their own version: “Code drunk,
            debug sober”. Honestly, though, you’re better off not writing or coding, especially anything tricky, while
            under the influence. I also think this goes a bit further, too: even if you’re sober, check to make sure
            you’re not being influenced by other chemical imbalances. Have you had enough sunlight lately? Do you need a
            drink of water (again)? Is your blood sugar too low or too high? Check in on your physical and mental
            states.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Talk about something else</h4>
    <p>Part of CHALTS is “loneliness” and I suggested you talk to other people, get some social interaction. It really
        does
        do a lot for you, even if it’s not in-person. Texting a friend, posting in a forum, or hanging out on social
        media
        can all help to boost your self-esteem (well, maybe not social media) and bring you back to feeling like a part
        of
        society again.</p>

    <p>The urge, though, is usually to talk about the problem you’re having. I think it’s better to talk about something
        completely different. Instead of asking Jim or Alisha about why your regular expression is only finding every
        other
        letter, ask Alisha to tell you about her last rollerderby game. Or find out your grandma’s best brownie recipe.
        Go
        ask the CEO about the last book she read. These all get your mind off of your problem and get you focusing on
        something else. And while you’re focused on a book recommendation, your brain is chipping away at the problem in
        the
        background.</p>

    <h4>Get out of there!</h4>
    <p>Sometimes you just don’t have the emotional capital required to talk to someone else. In these cases, I do
        whatever
        I can to change my surroundings. I go take a walk. I play a video game for a half hour or watch an episode of a
        favorite TV show or YouTube series. Or, and this goes back to the “angry” part of CHALTS, put on some favorite
        music
        and dance; the physical activity, combined with letting your mind rest for a bit, really helps to reset and
        repair
        mental batteries.</p>

    <p>Changing your environment itself can help a lot, too. Clean up your work area, open or close a window, restart
        your
        computer and organize the windows better. Small distractions, like not being able to quickly reach over and jot
        down
        a note, can cause big setbacks and frustrations. Yes, you’re “wasting time” cleaning up your desk, but you’re
        setting your mind up for better focus just five minutes from now.</p>

    <p>Once you’re focused and you’ve stamped down as many distractions as possible, give your problem another shot and
        see
        if it turns out to be a little more organized, too.</p>

    <h4>The 15-minute rule</h4>
    <p>And, lastly, you might have to just give up and ask your question. Before you do, though, try to follow the 15 (I
        actually prefer 30 but start small) minute rule. Here’s how it breaks down:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You have a problem. Spend 15 minutes trying to solve it on your own with a few different approaches. If that
            doesn’t
            work…</li>

        <li>Spend 15 minutes researching the problem. Check Google, Stack Overflow, a favorite programming community,
            the documentation, etc. Again, use different approaches to the research, different search terms and search
            engines.</li>
        <li>Now go back to #1. Hopefully, you’ve found something that helps you move to a new problem or just solves the
            whole
            thing outright. If so, awesome! But, if not, there’s one final step.</li>
        <li>Go ask someone for help. Swallow your pride and beat down that fear as best you can and go ask a friendly
            coworker,
            fellow student, mentor, etc for help with the problem. Explain what the problem is and where all you’ve
            looked for
            help. Talk about the solutions you tried, what you expected from them, and what you got.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This approach works really well for a couple of reasons. If you do finally end up asking for help, you’re showing
        your mentor that you’re coming to them after exhausting your other avenues of help. They won’t feel like you’re
        wasting their time (and you shouldn’t either!) and they won’t have you working in circles back over things
        you’ve
        already tried.</p>

    <p>Secondly, you’ll often find that you find the solutions on your own. Somewhere in the multiple approaches and
        multiple bits of research, you hit on something that either solves your problem or at least gives you a new
        problem.
        <strong>Celebrate these victories!</strong>

    <h4>You can do it if you want it</h4>
    <p>In the end, though, whether you find the answers on your own or you ask a friend, you’re still a programmer. It’s
        not cheating to look at documentation or places like Stack Overflow. I don’t know a single programmer that has
        much
        memorized beyond the basics of a language or two and maybe one framework.</p>

    <p><i>When someone tells you they’re there for your questions, believe them. As one of those people, I love getting
            questions and helping people fill in the gaps in their knowledge. Flipping on a light bulb for someone is
            one of the
            best feelings. And, I guarantee you, there’s something you can teach me, too!</i></p>
